# Food_content_app
Food content app project using Flask

In this project, the USDA food nutrients value database was used to create the content of a web app. This web app asks the user to insert a food name, and if it exists in the database, returns a selected list of nutrient values for this particular food. Otherwise, the app displays relevant messages asking for example the user to try again. 

Project steps:

•	Extract the database from USDA website 

•	Clean the database (remove columns)

•	Use Flask to create a server

•	Use html and css to create attractive visuals
